- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gnami225 
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, statistics, and machine learning.
- 🌍 I’m a statistician based in Côte d'Ivoire, working in a local company.
- 📈 I create and share projects that start with basic statistics and gradually increase in complexity, progressing towards machine learning, all implemented with Python.
- 🎓 My goal is to help beginners take their first steps in Python by offering a visual and intuitive approach to programming. I'm also learning along the way, so this is a journey of exploration and growth for me!
